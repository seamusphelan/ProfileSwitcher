<h3>Usage</h3>
<b>NB - this will only work on phones that have ProfileManager (e.g. CyanogenMod builds)</b>
<p>
Create schedules for when you want your phone to automatically change profiles. To create a schedule, 
chose "New schedule" in the menu.  Choose the profile you want to switch, the time of day (24 hour 
clock) and which days of the week.
<br>
For example: Imagine you have profiles Work, Home and Night.  You could have the following schedules.
<ul>
<li>Work @ 08:00 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday
<li>Home @ 10:30 on Saturday & Sunday
<li>Home @ 17:30 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday & Friday
<li>Night @ 23:30 on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday & Sunday
</ul>

<p>You can also set timed profiles - similar to the old Nokias :-) for once off occasions. e.g Going 
to the cinema. Choose "Timed Profile", pick profile Silent for 2 hours.

<b>Headset plug/unplug reset option.</b>
<br>Standard behaviour in Android is that plugging in a headset causes the volume 
settings etc. to switch to what they were the 
last time a headset was plugged in. Likewise for unplugging a headset.
If you change a profile (either manually or using this app) and then plug/unplug a 
headset, the volume settings will be changed (but the active profile will remain the same)
<br>
This is reason you may want to have the profile reset after a headset is plugged/unplugged. 

<p>
<b>Timed profile.</b>
<br>
At the end of a timed profile, it will revert to the profile that was active before the 
timed profile was created. If a scheduled profile change was supposed to happen, before the 
time profile has finished, it will revert to this profile.

<b>Bugs / funnies / TODO</b>
<ul>
<li>Toast are sent every time a profile changes (there is no option to turn this off)
<li>There is quite a bit of logging happening (this is still an alpha)
<li>TODO: Be able to create a schedule that switches to a profile for period of time and then reverts back (i.e. an automated timed profile).
</ul>
